## About Me

I am computer science major beginning my senior year at Southwestern University this fall. I applied to DREU because I am interested in becomming a data scientist, data analyst or researcher, and I wanted the opportunity to participate in faculty led academic computing research with a mentor to get a better idea of what graduate school and a career in this area might be like. 

## About My Mentor

[Luc Paquette](https://education.illinois.edu/profile/luc-paquette) is an associate professor in the department of curriculum & instruction. He completed his PhD in computer science at the University of Sherbrooke where he studied the design knowledge representations for intelligent tutoring systems and the use of those representations to automatically generate pedagogical content. After his PhD, professor Paquette worked as a post-doctoral research associate at Teachers College, Columbia University where he used educational data mining techniques and knowledge engineering techniques to study the behavior of students using digital learning environment.

## About My Project

I am assisting Dr. Paquette with his research on persistence in education. We will be collecting data from a Minecraft server where student participants will receive an introduction to computing. The data collected for analysis will focus on each student's level of engagement as they [create programs to guide the barrel bot through a series of obstacle courses](https://youtu.be/7PEeWMxOHKM?si=4hsWnwkE4zKcu_JX), and we will use this collected data to identify points of challenge for the students to better understand how students persist or do not persist when they face educational hurdles.
