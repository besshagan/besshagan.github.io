      <h2>About My Project</h2>
      <p>
        I assisted Dr. Luc Paquette with his research on persistence in education. We analyzed data collected from a 
        Minecraft-based virtual learning environment where student participants were introduced to computing concepts. 
        The collected data focused on each student's level of engagement as they created programs to guide the 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/7PEeWMxOHKM?si=4hsWnwkE4zKcu_JX" target="_blank">Barrel Bot</a> through a series 
        of obstacle courses. The goal of this analysis was to identify points of challenge to better understand how students 
        persist or fail to persist when facing educational hurdles.

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I built and maintained a SQL-to-Python data pipeline to extract and analyze student interaction logs from a
      database-backed virtual learning environment. I also collaborated with the development team to identify and
      resolve data quality and logging issues, supporting statistical analysis of student engagement and persistence.

      <h2>5-Week Progress Report</h2>
      <p>
        At the midpoint of the program, I reflected on my work preparing a SQL-to-Python data pipeline, learning to query the WHIMC database,
        and collaborating with the development team to support data collection and debugging.

      <h2>Final Technical Report</h2>
      <p>
      In my final report, I detail the full scope of my DREU project, including contributions to data preparation, analysis, and tool development
      for the WHIMC BarrelBot learning environment. I reflect on what I learned about educational research and the challenges of analyzing
      student behavior in virtual spaces.
