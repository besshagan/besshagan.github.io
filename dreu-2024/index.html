      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a computer science major beginning my senior year at Southwestern University this fall. 
        I applied to DREU because I am interested in becoming a data scientist, data analyst, or researcher, 
        and I wanted the opportunity to participate in faculty-led academic computing research with a mentor 
        to better understand what graduate school and a career in this field might entail.

      <h2>About My Mentor</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://education.illinois.edu/profile/luc-paquette" target="_blank">Luc Paquette</a> is an associate professor 
        in the Department of Curriculum & Instruction. He completed his PhD in computer science at the University of Sherbrooke, 
        where he studied the design of knowledge representations for intelligent tutoring systems and the use of those representations 
        to automatically generate pedagogical content. After his PhD, Professor Paquette worked as a post-doctoral research associate 
        at Teachers College, Columbia University, where he used educational data mining and knowledge engineering techniques 
        to study student behavior in digital learning environments.

      <h2>About My Project</h2>
      <p>
        I am assisting Dr. Paquette with his research on persistence in education. We are collecting data from a 
        Minecraft server where student participants are introduced to computing concepts. The collected data focuses on 
        each student's level of engagement as they create programs to guide the 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/7PEeWMxOHKM?si=4hsWnwkE4zKcu_JX" target="_blank">Barrel Bot</a> through a series 
        of obstacle courses. This analysis will help identify points of challenge and better understand how students 
        persist or fail to persist when facing educational hurdles.

      <h2>5-Week Progress Report</h2>
      <p>
        At the midpoint of the program, I reflected on my work preparing a SQL-to-Python data pipeline, learning to query the WHIMC database,
        and collaborating with the development team to support data collection and debugging.
