  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am computer science major beginning my senior year at Southwestern University this fall. 
    I applied to DREU because I am interested in becomming a data scientist, data analyst or researcher, 
    and I wanted the opportunity to participate in faculty led academic computing research with a mentor 
    to get a better idea of what graduate school and a career in this area might be like.

  <h1>About My Mentor</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="https://education.illinois.edu/profile/luc-paquette" target="_blank">Luc Paquette</a> is an associate professor 
    in the department of curriculum & instruction. He completed his PhD in computer science at the University of Sherbrooke 
    where he studied the design knowledge representations for intelligent tutoring systems and the use of those representations 
    to automatically generate pedagogical content. After his PhD, professor Paquette worked as a post-doctoral research associate 
    at Teachers College, Columbia University where he used educational data mining techniques and knowledge engineering techniques 
    to study the behavior of students using digital learning environment.

  <h1>About My Project</h1>
  <p>
    I am assisting Dr. Paquette with his research on persistence in education. We will be collecting data from a 
    Minecraft server where student participants will receive an introduction to computing. The data collected for 
    analysis will focus on each student's level of engagement as they create programs to guide the barrel bot through 
    a series of obstacle courses, and we will use this collected data to identify points of challenge for the students 
    to better understand how students persist or do not persist when they face educational hurdles.
