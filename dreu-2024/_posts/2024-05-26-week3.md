## May 27 - May 31

I'm still learning how to utilize the Pandas library in Python to do data analysis, but I was able to write a script that connects to the WHIMC database remotely to import tables as data frame objects and export them to Excel files in a local directory on my computer. I also wrote a script that calculates the Levenshtein distance (edit distance) between changes made to the directions stored in the Barrel Bot by the user every time they interact with it in the environment. It doesn't work perfectly yet, because it is still unclear which puzzle they are working on and when they complete that puzzle, but I'm proud of myself for getting as far as I have.

On Tuesday, I attended my second CS Research Group meeting where we discussed how to improve an existing grant proposal for a research study, and then I went to my first Lunch and Learn where I was introduced to the staff hosting these sessions and other CS students who are here for the summer doing research in the CS department.

On Wednesday, I attended the WHIMC Barrel Bot check-in meeting, my first strand3 meeting, and I had my weekly check-in meeting with Juan. Juan and I discussed the state of the data being collected and the code I've been working on. We discussed exploratory data analysis (EDA), how to make improvements to my code, and where to store calculated results. 

I spent the remainder of my week working on my script and learning more about how I can use Pandas data structures to merge tables for EDA. Luc and I didn't have our normal check-in meeting until Friday because he was traveling, but I had lots to share with him by the time he got back.
