## July 15 - July 19

I am excited to report that I finally got to work with some real data generated by children in the learning environment this week. On Monday, groups of roughly 20 children worked through the first three Barrelbot puzzles! Then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the same 20-ish students began at Puzzle 1 and worked through the entire learning environment at their own pace. The week leading up to this data collection was a little stressful, but definitely worth it! 

For instance, last week, Jeff and the WHIMC development team were making final adjustments to the environment to get ready for the camp and at some point during their updates last Thursday, my Python script for ONA began outputting CSV files that didn't make sense. Ultimately, I resolved these issues over the weekend by deleting one line of code. That one line of code was a patch I had added several weeks ago to adjust the coordinates of puzzle regions because the z-coordinates in the database were slightly off from the virtual environment between Puzzle 3 and the creative cooperative puzzle that follows it. I use these coordinates to add a puzzle_id column to all the tables I query from in the database to determine where the user is and which puzzles they're working on. Long story short, I removed the patch and let the information in the database determine the z-coordinates of puzzle regions, and presto chango! My script worked again!

Jeff and I had been talking about the camps over Slack last week, and this conversation continued into the weekend as well. Late Saturday night, Jeff asked if I'd be willing to test out the environment one last time with a test lane and an account he set up for me. So, on Sunday morning, I asked my roommate Katelyn if she'd be interested and willing to test the Barrel Bot learning environment and generate some data for me. She was more than happy to help, so I set everything up and handed her my laptop. I hung out nearby while she played and took a few notes, but mostly I wanted to see what the data would look like if I interfered as little as possible. She solved the first two puzzles but got stuck on puzzle 3 because of a bug in the learning environment, which I let Jeff know immediately. After this, Katelyn moved on to the creative section for a bit, but after placing a program in Barrel Bot that made him leave her puzzle area and enter the hallway that connects to the next user's lane, which it should not be able to do, she wanted to stop playing.

So, I switched gears and ran the data she had generated through my Python script for ONA, and I was disappointed to find that the output it generated was a mess. At this point, my script was working exactly as intended, but the data in the database logging button presses and successful outcomes did not reflect reality. I let Luc know about the situation and began patching my script to work around these issues so I'd be ready for the data collection starting the next day.

And, of course, while I was doing all of the above, I also used the Zoom link Luc had shared with me to attend the workshop he and Juan were hosting at the conference they were attending. I popped in throughout the day, but I lost track of time and missed the panel I was hoping to attend in the afternoon. Fortunately, despite juggling these activities, I was able to patch the latest version of the code before calling it an early night because I knew my last week in Illinois was going to be incredibly eventful!
