## July 15 - July 19

During my final week of the DREU program, I am excited to report that I will finally get my hands on some real data generated by children in the learning environment. On Monday, groups of roughly 20 children will be working on the first three Barrelbot puzzles! Then, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the same 20-ish students will start at puzzle 1 and work their way through the entire learning environment at their own pace.

The WHIMC development team, led by Jeff, has been making final adjustments to the environment to get ready for the camp. I started chatting with Jeff on Slack last week to get as much information as I could about the camp because I wanted to prepare for it as best as I could ahead of time. Unfortunately, at some point during the WHIMC updates on Thursday, my Python script for ONA began outputting CSV files that didn't make sense. I wasn't able to resolve the problem until Saturday because I took Friday off to go to Chicago. I eventually realized that deleting one line of code fixed the entire problem. That one line of code was a patch I had added several weeks ago to adjust the coordinates of puzzle regions because the z-coordinates in the database were slightly off from the virtual environment between puzzle 3 and the creative cooperative puzzle that follows it. I use these coordinates to add a puzzle_id column to all the tables I query in the script, which allows me to merge, drop rows, determine where the user is traveling, and which puzzles they're working on, etc. Long story short, I removed the patch and let the information in the database determine the z-coordinates of puzzle regions, and presto chango! My script worked again!

My conversation with Jeff continued into the weekend. Late Saturday night, Jeff asked if I'd be willing to test out the environment one last time with a test lane and an account he set up for me. So, Sunday morning, I asked my roommate Katelyn if she'd be interested and willing to test the Barrel Bot learning environment and generate some data for me. She was more than happy to help, so I set everything up and handed her my laptop. I hung out nearby while she played and took a few notes, but mostly I wanted to see what the data would look like if I interfered as little as possible. She solved the first two puzzles but got stuck on puzzle 3 because of a bug in the learning environment, which I let Jeff know immediately. After this, Katelyn moved on to the creative section for a bit, but after placing a program in Barrel Bot that made him leave her puzzle area and enter the hallway that connects to the next user's lane, which it should be able to do, she wanted to stop playing.

So, I switched gears and ran the data she had generated through my Python script for ONA, and I was disappointed to find that the output it generated was a mess. At this point, my script was working exactly as intended, but the data in the database logging button presses and successful outcomes did not reflect reality. I let Luc know about the situation and began patching my script to work around these issues so I'd be ready for the data collection beginning the next day.

And, of course, while I was doing all of the above, I used a Zoom link Luc had shared with me to attend the workshop he and Juan were hosting at the conference they were attending. I popped in throughout the day, but I lost track of time and missed the panel I was hoping to attend in the afternoon. Fortunately, despite juggling these activities, I was able to patch the latest version of the code, so I had dinner and headed to bed early knowing it was going to be an interesting and full last week for me in Illinois.
