## July 15 - July 19

I am excited to report that I finally got to work with some real data generated by children in the learning environment this week. The week leading up to this data collection was a little stressful, but definitely worth it! 

For instance, last week, Jeff and the WHIMC development team pushed some new updates and reset the learning environment to get ready for the camp. I was working on my Python script for ONA while they were doing this when suddenly my script began outputting CSV files that didn't make sense. I didn't understand what was happening, but I eventually resolved this issue over the weekend by deleting one line of code. That one line of code was a patch I had added several weeks ago to adjust the coordinates of puzzle regions from the database to correspond with the actual virtual environment. My best guess is the coordinates must have changed (ever so slightly) when they reset the environment, so I removed the patch to let the information in the database determine the z-coordinates of puzzle regions in my script, and presto chango! My script worked again! 

After I finished debugging (by unpatching) my script, I finished writing the code I was working on last week to add a status column to my ONA event log, and I received a late-night Slack message from Jeff asking if I'd be willing to test out the environment one last time for him. So, on Sunday morning, I asked my roommate Katelyn if she'd be interested and willing to generate some data for me. She was more than happy to help, so I set everything up and handed her my laptop. I hung out nearby while she played and took a few notes. She solved the first two puzzles but was unable to complete the third due to a bug in the learning environment, which I let Jeff know about immediately. After this, Katelyn moved on to the creative section for a bit, but after placing a program in Barrel Bot that made him leave her puzzle area and enter the hallway that connects to the next user's lane, which it should not be able to do, she wanted to stop playing.

So, I switched gears and ran the data she had generated through my Python script for ONA, and I was disappointed to find that the output it generated was a mess. At this point, my script was working exactly as intended, but the data in the database logging button presses and successful outcomes did not reflect reality. I let Luc know about the situation and began patching my script to work around these issues so I'd be ready for the data collection starting the next day. 

While I was doing all of the above, I also attended a conference workshop Luc and Juan were hosting over Zoom. I popped in throughout the day, but I lost track of time while I was coding and missed the panel I was hoping to attend in the afternoon. Fortunately, despite juggling these activities, I was able to patch the latest version of the code before calling it an early night because I knew my last week in Illinois was going to be incredibly eventful!

On Monday, data collection began. On the first day, roughly 100 campers were divided into 5 groups. These groups spent the day trying out the different camp experiences being offered, one of which was WHIMC's BarrelBot learning environment. Then, each student signed up for the activity they wanted to spend the rest of the week doing. Unsurprisingly, BarrelBot was the most popular choice! Seventeen students returned on Tuesday to work through the BarrelBot learning environment, starting from Puzzle 1 for a second time.

My analysis ends with Puzzle 3 because puzzles with fixed solutions beyond this point were not working properly before data collection, but with so many actual students running through the first 3 puzzles, I was hopeful about what I might discover. 

Accordingly, I spent the majority of my week working on my technical report and exploring Monday and Tuesday's data, but I didn't get as far as I would have liked because I was struggling to identify the 5 separate groups who all used the same user accounts on Monday. I reached out to Jeff a couple of times about this issue. Eventually, I discovered that there had been problems on-site getting the first group going, and the data for the fourth group had not logged into the database at all. The remaining data, from groups 2, 3, and 5 appeared reliable, so I proceeded under the assumption that I was looking at the behavior of 45 junior high school-aged students. 

Unfortunately, I found out late Friday afternoon that there had not been enough computers for all the students in each of the 5 groups throughout the day. So, some user behavior was generated by individual students and other user behavior was the result of two students sitting next to one another on the same computer working cooperatively, and I do not know how to distinguish between these users in the data.

Unaware of this limitation, I was struggling to make generalizations about student behavior using ONA, and I was hopeful that looking at Tuesday's data might help me make sense of the mathematical visualizations I was looking at. So, from Wednesday onward I focused my attention on Tuesday's data from a group of 17 students that ran through the first 3 puzzles for a second time.

While I was exploring this data set, I saw some interesting behavior, but I was concerned that I was also seeing real-life interventions taking place that would disrupt my ability to make generalizations about student behavior to identify markers of struggle and persistence. Between the ONA results and the ONA event log my script generated, I saw one group of students who may have been persisting suddenly give up while working on Puzzle 3. I was concerned that they may have been instructed to move on to Puzzle 4, a cooperative-creative area with no fixed solution. I also saw another group of students who struggled with Puzzle 2 and were unable to complete it suddenly completed Puzzle 3, which is much more difficult than Puzzle 2. I suspected that this group was struggling the most, so they were assisted in solving Puzzle 3. My suspicions about both groups were confirmed on Friday afternoon by Jeff, who had been there in person.

I guess the good news is that my script generates event log data that reflects reality. The bad news is that I'm out of time. I was unable to finish my final DREU technical report from UIUC, but I am determined to finish my analysis and report by Friday of next week once I return home to Texas.
