## June 10 - June 14

I began my week drafting the progress report for the third DREU milestone and meeting with Luc to discuss my progress and findings from last week. I spent a good portion of the remainder of my week writing and debugging a script that merges tables to calculate the distance and time between between interactions with the BarrelBot, and on Friday I used matplotlib to create my first visualiztions of this mock data. 

I also dropped in on a strand1 meeting, met virtually with Juan and the WHIMC BarrelBot developement team, and I attended the Lunch and Learn and CS Research and reading groups as usual. The strand1 meeting went in a direction I wasn't anticipating but found very interesting. They were discussing how to approach the design of pedagogical agent interventions for students whose first language is not American English. More specifically, they discussed Spanish and African American Vernacular English (AAVE). I do not think that everyone was on the same page concerning these considerations. Juan and I spent our time looking through my code to determine why it worked as intended for some sets of data, but not others. He was able to help me determine that my code needed to be adjusted to work with an edge case, where the user interacts with the BarrelBot more than once without movement between their interactions. Luc attended the BarrelBot development team meeting with me where we discussed the current changes to the envirnment and database. 

Colleen, the person who coordinated my stay at Preby Hall and invited me to the CS research and reading groups, was one of the presenters at this weeks Lunch and Learn, where she talked about networking. During a break out session, I met Tomas, a computer science student from Brazil who recently arrived at UIUC, and Evan, a machine learning major. By the end of the lecture, the students were primed to meet and mingle, so I met several other students in quick succession, which was incredibly overwhelming for me. Fortunately, I used what I had learned over lunch to introduce myself and express the genuine interest and curiousity I had for these other students before excusing myself because I needed to get back to work. 

In reality, I don't think Luc would have minded if I had spent more time talking with other students. I just didn't want to come off as rude or disinterested when the truth is, I'm an autistic adult learning to honor where I'm at in my body when I don't have the energy and mental resources to socialize or when I'm experiencing sensory overwhelm because I did not anticipate that I would suddenly be introduced to so many people at once. That said, I think I handled things well enough, and I'm hoping to spend more time with some of the people who took the time to approach me after next week's lecture.
