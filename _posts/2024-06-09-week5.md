## June 10 - June 14

I began my week drafting the progress report for the third DREU milestone and meeting with Luc to discuss my progress and findings from last week. I spent a good portion of the remainder of my week writing and debugging a script that merges tables to calculate the distance and time between between interactions with the BarrelBot, and on Friday I used matplotlib to create my first visualiztions of this mock data. 

I also dropped in on a strand1 meeting, met virtually with Juan and the WHIMC BarrelBot developement team, and I attended the Lunch and Learn and CS Research and reading groups as usual. The strand1 meeting went in a direction I wasn't anticipating but found very interesting. They were discussing how to approach the design of pedagogical agent interventions for students whose first language is not American English. More specifically, they discussed Spanish and African American Vernacular English (AAVE). I do not think that everyone was on the same page concerning these considerations, and some of the language used in this discussion was concerning but not surprising to me.

Generally, I observe during these meetings, but having recently completed a cultural anthropoly course with Dr. Johnson, a race scholar at Southwestern, I decided to speak up in this meeting to reiterate that AAVE is a language unto iteself by asking why AAVE is different from Spanish, German, or any other living language that changes over time. I immediately began to have an anxiety attack as I asked this, because I have severe social anxiety, but I don't regret speaking up.
